  "description": "Genius Collectibles (\"GENFTs\") are obtained by using the Genius Smart Financial Contracts, the ecosystem that manages the $GENI utility token. You can obtain a Genius Collectible by interacting with the contracts: Create a Miner, End a Miner, Redeem $GENI for collateral in the Stability Pool, and more! You can even buy Booster Packs and Ultimate Packs, which contain 4 and 16 random GENFTs, respectively. But be quick, because when a New Edition of GENFTs are released, the prior Edition's GENFTs can never be minted again!
